        <h2> Summary </h2>
        <p> 
            Over the course of the semester, we wanted to examine what characteristics affect the way that students 
            test in public schools in Massachussets. As before (in Blog Post II), we used a success metric based on 
            student-level test data for each school. We defined the success metric as follows:
            
                <center> (sum of english score by each student that year) &frasl; (number of students who took the english test ) <br> + <br>(sum of math score by each student that year) &frasl;
     (Number of students who took the maths test)</center>
                <center> <i> All * 1.67 to scale it up to a max score of 10 </i> </center> <br>
            
            Ultimately, we settled on the following questions:
            <ol>
              <li>What is the impact of location on public school success?</li>
              <li>Which characteristics are the most important in determining a schoolâ€™s success?</li>
              <li>Given certain characteristics, how accurately can we predict how well such a school will succeed?</li>
              <li>How similarly do schools with alike characteristics perform?</li>
            </ol> 
            We sought about answering these in three different ways: <strong>Map Visualization, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Machine Learning.</strong>
        </p>
        <h2> Map Visualization </h2>
            Since our third and fourth blog post, we have improved our map visualization such that the final version allows the user to observe
            changes in success over time (2002-2014). Additionally, we have scaled the bubble sizes to the size of the schools. We removed english success because there was no data before 2006.
            From this map we were able to observe that success clearly increases over time as there is a dramatic increase in the number of green
            schools (representing better performing schools) over time. Additionally, we were able to gain insights related to the question
            of how location impact success because we can see there are some clusters of schools that are underporming such as in
            Springfield (circled in yellow above), Boston,  Fall River and New Bedford.

        <h2> Summary </h2>
        <p> 
            Over the course of the semester, we wanted to examine what characteristics affect the way that students 
            test in public schools in Massachussets. As before (in Blog Post II), we used a success metric based on 
            student-level test data for each school. We defined the success metric as follows:
            
                <center> (sum of english score by each student that year) &frasl; (number of students who took the english test ) <br> + <br>(sum of math score by each student that year) &frasl;
     (Number of students who took the maths test)</center>
                <center> <i> All * 1.67 to scale it up to a max score of 10 </i> </center> <br>
            
            Ultimately, we settled on the following questions:
            <ol>
              <li>What is the impact of location on public school success?</li>
              <li>Which characteristics are the most important in determining a schoolâ€™s success?</li>
              <li>Given certain characteristics, how accurately can we predict how well such a school will succeed?</li>
              <li>How similarly do schools with alike characteristics perform?</li>
            </ol> 
            We sought about answering these in three different ways.
